<![CDATA[
<p>The ReCommended Extension augments the sophisticated code analysis engine by providing more rules not (yet) available from JetBrains. Among the most interesting features are

- advanced disposable object analysis built around the "[MustDisposeResource]" and "[HandlesResourceDisposal]" annotations,
- detection of more cases where collection expressions can be used,
- detection of redundant assertions,
- inappropriate use of "async void",
- exception analyzer (exceptions that should never be thrown or caught, exceptions thrown in unexpected locations),
- array initializers (empty arrays or arrays initialized with default values),
- "await" expression analyzer (add ".ConfigureAwait(false)" for last expressions),
- "ValueTask" analyzer (possible multiple consumption),
- LINQ and "string" method analyzers (to encourage use of modern language features),
- incorrect use of "ArgumentException" constructor parameters,
- locking on weak identity objects,
- use of "yield return" inside the "lock" blocks,
- incorrect use of ReSharper annotations,
- and lots more.

Most of the highlightings also have quick fixes for obvious solutions.

Another feature of the extension are new context actions that simply save time for accomplishing everyday tasks, e.g. for adding ReSharper annotations, adjusting XML doc comments, setting language injections, etc.</p>
