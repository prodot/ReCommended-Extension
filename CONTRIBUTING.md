## Versioning Guidelines

The extension uses 3 numeric components, _Major_._Minor_._Patch_. The following table summarizes the rules:

| Update                           | Component to increment | Example           |
|----------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| Compatibility update             | _patch_               | `1.0.6` → `1.0.7` |
| Bug-fix/minor improvement update | _minor_               | `1.0.6` → `1.1.0` |
| Feature update                   | _major_               | `1.0.6` → `2.0.0` |

Please note: when a component is incremented, the subcomponents are reset.
